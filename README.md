##About Lomo camera

“The LOMO LC-A (Lomo Kompakt Automat) is a fixed lens, 35 mm film, leaf shutter, zone focus, compact camera introduced in 1984. The design is based on the Cosina CX-2.
In 2005, production of the original Lomo LC-A was discontinued. Its replacement, the LC-A+, was introduced in 2006 and production moved to China. The LC-A+ featured the original LC-A lens manufactured by LOMO PLC in Russia. This changed in 2007 and lenses on subsequent models have been made in China.[1] Some LC-As were sold badged as Zenith[2], this label was only a sticker underneath the lens. Zenit (Zenith in some countries) is a trademark of KMZ (Krasnogorsk Mechanical Works).” (wikipedia)

##About Holga camera

“The Holga is a medium format 120 film toy camera, made in China, known for its low-fidelity aesthetic.
The Holga’s low-cost construction and simple meniscus lens often yields pictures that display vignetting, blur, light leaks, and otherdistortions. The camera’s limitations have brought it a cult following among some photographers, and Holga photos have won awards and competitions in art and news photography.” (wikipedia)
